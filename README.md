# OS meets Hardware
So premise is that Koon Wen is interested in Compilers, and Joel is interested in hardware. We thought that it might be interesting to find out
if we could boot the Raspberry Pi with an OS that Koon Wen has used before (MirageOS). The issue here is that we need to find out how to create
drivers for the OS so that it can interact with the Raspberry Pi. Neither of us are clear (yet) on how that works, might be fun to find out through
implemenatation :)

## Hardware
The most available model is the Raspberry Pi Zero.
